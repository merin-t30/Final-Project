Emotion Detection System

This project is an AI-powered Web Application that analyzes the emotional tone of a given text. It utilizes Python and the Flask web framework to provide a user interface where individuals can enter statements and receive a detailed breakdown of the emotions detected.

The core analysis is performed using the IBM Watson NLP (Natural Language Processing) Library. The application sends the user's text to a pre-trained model which evaluates the content for five key emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, and sadness.

Key Features:
AI Integration: Leverages Watson NLP for high-accuracy emotion analysis.

Modular Design: Built as a standalone Python package (EmotionDetection) for reusability.

Web Interface: A clean, browser-based UI developed with Flask, HTML, and CSS.

Error Handling: Robust processing for blank or invalid inputs.

Unit Tested: Includes a suite of tests to ensure reliable output for various emotional contexts.

Static Code Analysis: Follows industry standards with a perfect Pylint score for code quality.
